1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
   
No, we cannot test if 2 components work together (object sent vs object recieved). We can test to see if we can send something. 

1) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

Yes, I would want to create a a unit test that test max message length since we do not want to send messages that are too long.
